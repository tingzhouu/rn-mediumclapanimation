# RN-MediumClapAnimation

This is to share the source code of recreating [Medium's](https://medium.com/) clap animation from following the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe7F6Hdss9k).

I was unable to find the Github repository and thought this would be helpful for those who were trying out the tutorial.

Credits to [Coding is Love](https://codingislove.com/) for a detailed and easy-to-follow tutorial.
